# Scala.world 2017 Akka Typed Workshop

In preparation of the the workshop please clone this repository and run at least `sbt update` within it from a location with reasonable internet connectivity.
It would also be helpful to import the project into your IDE of choice, adding source attachments if you wantâ€”remember that these are pretty big downloads as well.

You are also welcome to explore [Akka Typed Session](https://github.com/rkuhn/akka-typed-session) for a process DSL on top of Akka Typed that allows you to compose Actor behaviors from composable fragments.

Enjoy!
